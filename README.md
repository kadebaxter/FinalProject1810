Final Project for CS1810

---
I will build a piano sheet music organizer. The idea is that the website will have seperate pages that complete the following functions: Organize a list of piano music into favorites, create playlists, and add other piano songs that aren't included in the provided list. (if there is enough time I could make it all based on usernames and such) On the favorites page the drag and drop feature will be used as well as a sorting feature to find the desired songs of the user. I really like to play piano but find it hard to organize all of the songs that I know and enjoy into one place. This website will provide me, and people like me, to have a place to do that.
